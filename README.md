Gallagher is an attempt to make a basic version of Galaga, the classic arcade game.

## GAMEPLAY
Gallagher uses a portrait orientation to emulate the look of an arcade cabinet.
Enemies spawn from the top of the screen and move toward the player.
At this point the game runs infinitely, though I plan to add levels at a later date.
The game tracks the amount of enemies the player kills, as well as their accuracy.
The score for each kill is calculated according to the accuracy at the time, so your score will increase faster if your accuracy is kept high.

## CONTROLS

    Arrow keys to move
